##### Module Version:

Let us know what version of Falcon module you are using.  Please supply the verbatim output from running “./control version”.  If you're filing a ticket on a version of module which is not the latest, we'd greatly appreciate it if you could retest on the latest version first.  We don't expect you to test against the development branch most of the time, but we may ask for that if you have cycles.  Thanks!

##### Module Configuration:

What have you changed about your Falcon module installation?  What configuration settings have you changed/added/removed?  Compare your cfg.json against a clean version from Github and let us know what's different.

##### Environment:

What OS are you running Falcon from and what OS are you monitoring?  Examples include RHEL 5/6, Centos 5/6, Ubuntu 12.04/13.10, *BSD, Solaris.  If this is a generic feature request or it doesn’t apply, just say “N/A”.  Not all tickets may be about operating system related things and we understand that.
